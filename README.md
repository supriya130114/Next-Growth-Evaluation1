Part 2
Question-1
Check if the sentence is Grammatically correct: Please use any pre-trained model or use text from open datasets. Once done, please evaluate the English Grammar in the text column of the dataset. DataSet Link
Sol. Built a function using Language Tool and TextBlob modules that can take text as input and run tests to check if the sentence is gramatically correct, then applied the function on given dataset. Generated a new dataset with all gramatically incorrect sentences. To check code solution see (Part 2) Question 1

Questions
Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution).
A. During a project where I given a task to build a machine learning model that predicts if a website domain is real or malicious, the model was also supposed to be deployed as an API which takes user input of an URL, The deployment process was particularly difficult as model had many features and data preprocessing was to be done on each feature to match user's input. After alot of time & effort we managed to get the work done.

Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
V' is a vector space
every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?

The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b
Answer - The set of pairs (a,b) for all real a >= b
